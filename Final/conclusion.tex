\section{Conclusion}
This overview of kernel implementations of various drivers, system calls, and other constructs in the context of Windows, and FreeBSD in comparison to Linux show how the three kernels are similar and different. Each of the kernel related functionalities show the common theme of FreeBSD and Linux being very similar, with Windows taking a different route in terms of actual implementation. However, in the end, Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows keep the overall semantics of processes, I/O, memory, from an abstracted perspective the same.
